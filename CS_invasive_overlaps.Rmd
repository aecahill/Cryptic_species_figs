## CS and invasive species overlap

Trying to figure out the overlap between our CS database and other databases of invasive species

First, read in files

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(cowplot)
library(wesanderson)


survey <- read.csv(file="978_species_clean_may17.csv"   , header=TRUE ) #Adjusted Nov 15 2023 to fix errors in duplicated species

# Load the WoRMS database (Not sure I need this???)
# This version, for whatever reason, is ONLY ANIMAL SPECIES (from Anne)
# That is fine; it's what I want anyway
worms <- read.csv('taxon.csv',header=TRUE) 

wrims<-read.csv(file="WRIMS_taxon.csv"   , header=TRUE )

#Now filter to only animal species
wrims<-filter(wrims,(kingdom=="Animalia" & taxonRank=="Species")) 
# 2716 species remaining

#Next, take the species names, compare them, and put into a separate database

overlap<- c() # blank dataframe

matchlist<-wrims$acceptedNameUsage %in% survey$acceptedName_wormsV1  #make vector of cases in wrims that have a match in the CS survey

#now this loop take the values for which there is a match and extracts them from the wrims set to make a dataframe
for (i in 1:length(matchlist)){
  if (matchlist[i] == TRUE)
    overlap<-rbind(overlap,wrims[i,])
}

write.csv(overlap,"invasive_CS.csv")

write.csv(table(overlap$class),"invasiveCS_class.csv")
write.csv(table(survey$class_wormsV1),"CS_class.csv")
write.csv(table(wrims$class),"invasive_class.csv")


```

Next step - heat map comparing the relative prevalence in the databases?
